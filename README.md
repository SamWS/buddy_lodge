#BuddyLodge - An excuse to go...

##How to Use

[View App](buddylodge)

This is an app inspired by airbnb, but applying to pets. The idea is that people who are going on a holiday, or even just leaving their home for a few days, and don't want to put their pets in a kennel, can post a listing and find someone to house/pet sit for that period.

On the flip side, the advantage of applying to be a pet sitter means free accomodation for wherever you may be going. If you're only popping into Sydney for a weekend, or Brisbane for a week, why not check out buddylodge and see if there's something

##Explanation of Technologies

This app is built on rails. I used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Ruby
* Javascript
* Materialize
* GoogleMaps API
* Ajax
* Geocoder Gem - Ruby
* GoogePlaces API

##Approach Taken

A few months ago I went to Adelaide with my room mate and, both of us being from NSW, we had nobody to check up on our pets. This made me think about how easy it is for people to find pet sitters, and I thought, why not give people an incentive to come watch your pets for you via free accommodation.

The whole basis of this website is for people to find somebody to watch their beloved fur family while they're not there for extended periods.

I decided to inspect airbnb and gain as much inspiration from their site as I possibly could.
